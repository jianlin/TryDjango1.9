## Making sure you have Python

Since some 3rd party modules may require Python 2, so
for the moment, let's stick with Python 2.

To make sure it is installed on your Mac:

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.5

## Install pip, by going to

https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip

get

https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

now run

    $ sudo python get-pip.py

and now if you check that pip is installed:

    $ pip --version
    pip 8.0.2 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)

## Now install virtualenv

The webpage is at http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html

To install on Mac:

    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

Checking it is installed:

    $ virtualenv --version
    14.0.6


## Install virtualenvwrapper

Follow the instructions on http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

Essentially, it is

    $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

and adding these lines to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc

    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
    source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

## So now you have "workon", due to virtualenvwrapper

Restart your bash.  This is important.

Now you can use workon, which gives you an empty list

    $ workon
    $             # <-- nothing is printed
